Assignment Reflection
GitHub Repository Overview
In this assignment, I worked on a social media application. The project aimed to provide a platform for users to connect, share content, and engage with one another through posts.

Achievements
During the development of this project, I successfully implemented several key features and functionalities:

User Authentication: I established a robust user authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions securely.

Profile Management: I created user profile pages that display user information, including bios and posts.

Post Creation: Users can create posts, enabling them to share their thoughts and updates effectively.

Dark Mode Toggle: Using Radix UI, I integrated a dark mode toggle that enhances the user experience by allowing users to switch between light and dark themes easily. This feature not only improves accessibility but also caters to user preferences, making the application visually appealing in different lighting conditions.

Tailwind CSS: For styling the application, I utilised Tailwind CSS to streamline the design process. Tailwind CSS allowed me to implement responsive and consistent styles across the app, making the UI clean, modern, and easy to maintain. Its utility-first approach greatly improved my efficiency in building out the user interface.

Challenges and Unachieved Goals
While I made significant progress, there were certain requirements that I was unable to fully implement:


User Following/Followers Functionality: I intended to create a feature that would allow users to follow others, but I struggled with the database schema and query logic to implement this effectively.

Difficulties Encountered
The primary challenges I faced with these tasks stemmed from a lack of experience with real-time communication and database management:

Database Schema Complexity: Designing a database schema that supports user relationships (like following) proved to be more complex than anticipated. I had to reevaluate my initial design and spend additional time troubleshooting queries, which impacted my ability to complete this feature in the timeframe.

Conclusion
This assignment was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to develop essential skills in full-stack development. Despite the challenges I faced, I was able to achieve a functional social media application that meets many core requirements. Moving forward, I plan to revisit the features I could not implement, particularly focussing on real-time functionalities and improving my database management skills. Overall, I am proud of the progress I've made and look forward to further refining this project.
